Phenomenological Analysis of AI Prompting
Supplementary Data and Python Scripts

Project Overview
This repository contains supplementary Python code and data for the article:
“Critical Philosophy and the Foundations of Prompting in Artificial Intelligence”.

The project explores the philosophical, technical, and phenomenological dimensions of prompting in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT. Using a critical phenomenological approach, this research investigates how prompts act as mediators between human intentionality and machine outputs.
